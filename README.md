# Optimal-Placement-of-EV-charging-stations-in-context-of-Indian-urban-cities
**Brief**//

With increasing energy consumption, dependency on fossil fuels, increase in carbon foot-prints, a paradigm shift towards sustainable and viable options is necessary. As an effort
towards greener technology, the inclusion of electric vehicles and electrification of transportation systems is being encouraged in various countries. The introduction of alternative vehicle technologies in the existing self-contained transportation system poses questions and challenges. Solely expanding the population of EVs in a city without enough road connections and corresponding charging and parking infrastructure will suppress the feasibility of EVs.
Thus, supportive charging infrastructure is of utmost priority for large-scale adoption of EV systems. The charging station placement is a complex optimization problem involving power distribution network and road network and thus its solution must superpose the considerations
of both the systems. Therefore, in order to find an optimal solution to this problem, multi-stage multi-objective solution approach is followed. Stage I aims at determining the candidate locations based on parameters like voltage stability factor, distance between nodes of traffic and distribution networks and congestion. Furthermore, in stage II optimization of the candidate locations based on cost of installations, penalties, waiting time etc.is carried and trade-off solutions are obtained. Initially, analysis is done on a 25-node transport network superposed on a 33-bus radial distribution network. Thereafter, the proposed model is applied to real urban network. (Chandigarh city)

Compared to the existing works, the present work has following contributions:
• Two stage planning model has been laid for the optimal placement of EV charging station.In first stage, candidate locations are found followed by the optimization to get the best results.
• The charging station placement problem is modelled in the context of Indian urban city Chandigarh. The cities will be having large EV users, hence, there will be a necessity of sustainable charging infrastructure.
• This work focuses on placing the EV charging station taking into account both the transport and electric grid parameters.
