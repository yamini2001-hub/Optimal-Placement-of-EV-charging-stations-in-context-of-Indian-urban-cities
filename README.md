# Optimal-Placement-of-EV-charging-stations-in-context-of-Indian-urban-cities
With increasing energy consumption, dependency on fossil fuels, increase in carbon foot-prints, a paradigm shift towards sustainable and viable options is necessary. As an effort
towards greener technology, the inclusion of electric vehicles and electrification of transportation systems is being encouraged in various countries. The introduction of alternative vehicle
technologies in the existing self-contained transportation system poses questions and challenges. Solely expanding the population of EVs in a city without enough road connections
and corresponding charging and parking infrastructure will suppress the feasibility of EVs.
Thus, supportive charging infrastructure is of utmost priority for large-scale adoption of EV
systems. The charging station placement is a complex optimization problem involving power
distribution network and road network and thus its solution must superpose the considerations
of both the systems. Therefore, in order to find an optimal solution to this problem, multi-stage multi-objective solution approach is followed. Stage I aims at determining the candidate
locations based on parameters like voltage stability factor, distance between nodes of traffic
and distribution networks and congestion. Furthermore, in stage II optimization of the candidate locations based on cost of installations, penalties, range anxiety etc.is carried and off
solutions are obtained. Initially, analysis is done on a 25-node transport network superposed
on a 33-bus radial distribution network. Thereafter, the proposed model is applied to real
urban network. (Chandigarh city)
